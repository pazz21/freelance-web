                    <p>BRVS produces J2EE and .NET based multi-tiered, object-oriented software designs that support multiple channels and highly distributed networks of corporate and partner application servers and backend systems for customer-service oriented companies.</p>
                    <p>Our approach is reflected in our domain-specific frameworks, which loosely integrate enterprise applications with best-of-breed third party products through web-services, XML messaging, well-designed Java interfaces and abstract classes. We promote the sophisticated use of metadata and meta-tags to ensure the highest level of development effectiveness and run-time efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Our frameworks accommodate corporate intranets, extranets and the public Internet. We recognize that the lines between these worlds are fading, and we anticipate this evolution in the design of our frameworks. A more thorough review of our vision is further developed below through a discussion of the technologies and contexts that form the focus of our development efforts.</p>

                    <p>Our vision for Enterprise Application Integration is the creation of a real-time, 24 x 7 eco-system, which ties together a company's employees, its partners and customers. Business processes are supported by business applications, which in turn use shared business application services, tied together by integration middleware. Business services are more generic in nature and can be shared among applications. Examples of shared services are content management, user profiling and user security. Integration services allow the various application and services to communicate.</p>
                    <p>Integration of business applications is driven by an integration framework, which defines the cross-application process workflow in a flexible multi-tiered object-oriented (delegating) architecture and takes proactive action in response to significant events in the workflow.</p>
                    <p>Distributed systems and "publish and subscribe" messaging technologies are particularly effective in marshalling worldwide forces within and outside the company to address exceptional events in the basic workflow. BRVS Group produces event-driven architectures that exploit publish and subscribe systems, and encourage distribution of resources.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The e-CRM vision is to build a venue for customer sales, marketing and service staff to work productively and creatively without any involvement from software engineers. This entails the loose integration of sales force automation systems, contact management systems and CRM systems that share this information across the company. BRVS Group solutions in this space are based on best-of-breed CRM products from companies that understand sales, marketing, and service, and at the same time have significant insight into what this means on the Internet. Since this vision of e-CRM is still developing, we can expect considerable innovation in the years to come. Therefore a flexible architecture becomes not just important, but crucial.</p>
                    <p>BRVS Group's composite architecture for e-CRM follows a strict methodology for organizing and developing frameworks through functional layering, interaction models, metadata and message layering, the introduction of a unified dynamic profile, and the appropriate use of web services and messaging technologies (store and forward, publish and subscribe, etc.). This has as much to do with facilitating modular change and evolution as to improving the understanding and management of the system.</p>
                    <p>The functionality associated with e-CRM is also useful within the corporation. The face the company presents to the employee is essential in establishing a corporate identity with accompanying corporate values and knowledge. </p>

                    <p>A portal is a customizable destination for multiple channels that provides continuously changing news, resources, applications, and functionality all on one "control panel", tailored to the specific requirements of the user. The portal "control panel" can be configured in real-time for an employee, customer or a partner, once the user has logged onto the site. Thus one portal platform can be used for multiple business units, both within the corporation and outside of it. The cost-benefit ratio becomes compelling, particularly when the corporate, extranet and Internet portals are combined. The following benefits are frequently identified: increased site traffic, increased productivity, increased job effectiveness, and lower information delivery costs.</p>
                    <p>The portal approach of organizing information has been found to be remarkably effective, particularly when associated with a degree of customization. The two most frequently stated business reasons for initiating corporate portals are the pursuit of aggressive growth and knowledge management across distributed personnel and business units.</p>
                    <p>A portal can take exceptional advantage of a planned object-oriented architecture. BRVS Group designs architectures for second-generation portal products, which run on J2EE and .NET application servers. Second-generation portals can therefore take advantage of advanced clustering and fail-over, sophisticated load balancing schemes, and robust application integration frameworks to ensure a faster and more reliable customer experience. In addition, second-generation portals can select, aggregate, and tailor data to various channels, including mobile phones and wireless Internet devices.</p>
